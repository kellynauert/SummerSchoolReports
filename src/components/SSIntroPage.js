            An online quiz platform that uses Common Core mathematics standards

            At this point, students have discovered their gaps in math
            understanding and have reviewed the material through tasks on

            see growth in their estimated grade level understanding. The more
            check-ins they completed, the more chance they had to show their
            growth.

            An online mathematics curriculum where students completed tasks in
            order to prepare for the growth phase of Waypoints. Students were
            assigned tasks based on their Waypoints gaps, and those tasks would
            adapt to the studentâ€™s performance by asking more or less of the
            questions they needed to see.

            other tools.
