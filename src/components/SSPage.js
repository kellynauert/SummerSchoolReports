              An online quiz platform that uses Common Core mathematics

              and see growth in their estimated grade level understanding. The
              more check-ins they completed, the more chance they had to show

              The Diagnostic Phase consists of 10 check-ins that gives us a base

              An online mathematics curriculum where students completed tasks in
              order to prepare for the growth phase of Waypoints. Students were
              assigned tasks based on their Waypoints gaps, and those tasks
              would adapt to the studentâ€™s performance by asking more or less of
              the questions they needed to see.

              whiteboard, chat box, and other tools.
